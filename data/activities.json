In 2021, he added a second location in Fort Collins that offers the same down-home flavors and familiar smokehouse favorites, all filtered through a chef's detail-oriented lens. ($$)"

The team, made up of longtime fine-dining pros, serves a menu filled with fun takes on comfort food and hyper-regional dishes inspired by the city’s many transplants, like the Mississippi slug burger loaded with 'too many pickles,' the Oklahoma fried onion burger and a Southern favorite, boiled peanuts.

Street Feud got its start at Avanti and later moved into Number Thirty Eight; in late 2021, Verrier finally found the right space for his own digs, covering the walls in DIY collages and street art. Like a mixtape that you’d play on the collection of vintage boomboxes in the entryway, the menu is loaded with hits, all packed with bold flavors. ($$)"

Chef/owner Noy Farrell visits her home country regularly, touring Thailand on the hunt for new flavors and trends. Light and vibrant salads share space on the menu with blazing-hot preparations and complex soups — all with the fresh flavors of Farrell’s kitchen garden. ($)"

But you can also dig further into Indian — and Nepali — cuisine at this spot, which debuted in 2020 and added a second location off East Sixth Avenue in late 2022. The street-food section of the menu offers the chance to experience the textures and bright, fresh flavor of items like bhel puri. Momo — Nepali dumplings — are a draw as well, as are a slew of curries and other dishes that will expand your taste horizons. ($$)"

The small menu board lists a variety of options, but most people come for one thing: the Italian sausage sandwich. Don't expect a huge, messy, red-sauce-soaked situation here. Instead, Vinnola's serves a housemade, flat Italian sausage patty on a super-soft yeasty roll baked on site. It comes topped with peppers and onions and a large side of red sauce for dipping or smothering, as well as a bag of Lay’s. Pair it with an Italian soda, and plan to spend some time post-meal checking out the selection of Italian goodies, from pasta to pizzelles. ($)"

Its new Hilltop home is spacious, with cozy booths and a patio with extra seating out front; the menu has all the classics, from pastrami on rye and matzoh ball soup to black-and-white cookies. ($$)"
