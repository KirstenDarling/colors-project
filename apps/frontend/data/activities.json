In the front dining room, you can order whole pies along with appetizers, wine, cocktails and more. All of the pizza is made on sourdough crust, but Redeemer mixes its artisan approach to dough with classic, craveable components like ooey, gooey, low-moisture mozzarella. Don't forget to order sides of both the hot honey and dilly ranch. ($$)"

Inside, decades of cigarette-smoke stains were scrubbed away, new floors and wood paneling were installed, and a billiards room was added at the back. The original Kentucky Inn never had much of a kitchen, but the expansion brought a menu of bar favorites and a few Southern specialties to match the Kentucky theme, including the award-winning KY Cuban.

The no-frills neighborhood joint attracts a fair number of easygoing regulars to its early-morning happy hours, and with its nondescript furnishings, it seems like not a whole lot has changed here in the last few decades, which is a big part of the Ralston's charm. Entertainment options include a jukebox, a few pool tables and pinball machines, and plenty of football and hockey watch parties. "

    "description": "Alana from Axios Denver says: I recently popped into The Greenwich, a lively and eclectic 130-seat restaurant focusing on New American and Mediterranean flavors. Why it matters: Quickly becoming my new favorite date spot, this snazzy eatery — whose head chef hails from New York — brings the Lower West Side to the heart of RiNo. Behind the airy and intimate space is Delores Tronco, a Greeley native who co-founded Work & Class before moving east to open a restaurant in Greenwich Village. Details: The family-style menu centers around seasonal vegetables, locally sourced meat and pizza. The restaurant also features more than 70 wines and craft beers from Colorado and New York. Two standouts: The torn cucumber salad with a creamy lemon-dill yogurt sauce, mint and a crunchy combo of Egyptian nuts, seeds and spices ($10); and the juicy roasted clams in a lemony, garlic-scape butter broth with crusty house-baked bread ($21). Of note: The wall art pays tribute to Tronco's late friend Ricky Powell, a New York street photographer known for shots of hip-hop culture and pop icons in the 1980s and 90s, who died during the pandemic."
